            <h2>Biography</h2> 
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at VinUniversity. I hold a PhD and completed my post-doctoral research at Deakin University, as well as a Master’s degree from Queensland University of Technology, Australia. I have published nine papers, including six in Q1 journals, in top-tier venues such as TDSC, and one in a B-ranked conference. Throughout my academic journey, I have mentored students in publishing high-impact papers, contributed to an Elsevier book chapter, and received several prestigious awards, including the School of Information Technology Higher Degree by Research Award for the 2022 Academic Year, QUT Dean’s List recognitions in 2019 and 2020, and third place in the 2022 Country to Country CTF (C2C) Cybersecurity Challenge hosted by MIT. I have also secured a successful grant, won an international prize, and gained extensive experience collaborating with industry partners. My teaching roles have received high ratings, with positive feedback from students. Additionally, I hold professional certifications in cybersecurity (Certified Ethical Hacker), machine learning (IBM Machine Learning), IoT, quantum computing, cryptography, blockchain, and more. My expertise lies in cybersecurity, AI technology, network security, and quantum technology, with a particular focus on machine learning and data science.</p>

            <h2>Mentorship</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Mentoring and supervising higher-degree research students has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my academic career. My ability to inspire and lead student has led to successful research outcomes and significantly contributed to our growth as scholars. Currently I am also working with other PhD students at Deakin with Dr. Sood in contributing and sharing our research.</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">At Deakin University, during the third year of my studies I have had the privilege of guiding a new student (Mr. Gurpreet Singh) of my PhD supervisor (<a href="https://experts.deakin.edu.au/12600-keshav-sood">Dr. Keshav Sood</a>). During weekly meetings, I contributed to developing and refining his research questions, helped him navigate the complexities of academic research journey, provided mentorship as well as shared my own research experience with him for him, etc. I am glad to mention that the supportive environment we have created resulted in a joint publication (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492991">link</a>) which is demonstrated evidence of my ability to supervise HDR candidates. </li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">During my postdoc, I had the opportunity to guide a Master's student, Mr. Michael, supervised by Dr. Sood. I supported him in writing and revising a book chapter, which has been preliminarily accepted and will be published by Elsevier (Scopus).</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="collaboration">
            <h2>Research collaboration</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">These experiences have given me insight into the process of securing research funding, and working on critical technologies has positioned me well to pursue future funding opportunities. My colleagues and I submitted an internal grant application focused on mitigating software supply chain security issues and received a successful outcome. I am closely working with <a href="https://experts.deakin.edu.au/12600-keshav-sood">Dr. Keshav Sood</a> on submitting an external grant application (as co-lead) to the Department of Defence, which is an extension of Dr. Sood’s previous project.</p>
